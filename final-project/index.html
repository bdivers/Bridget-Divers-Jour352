      <center><p class="intro-text">The United States Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that the average person generates over 4 pounds of trash every day and about 1.5 tons of solid waste per year.</p></center>

      <p>COLLEGE PARK, MD. – For over a decade the University of Maryland has intertwined sustainability into the campus community. </p>

      <p>Efforts to make UMD a green campus started back in 2007 and have expanded to reach all core functioning elements of the university.</p>

      <p>All the work that has been put in to make changes that will save the planet has not gone unnoticed.</p>

      <p>Abbie Malloy, a Junior Environmental Science and Policy Major, is extremely passionate about sustainability. She told me that she appreciates everything the university has done thus far and looks forward to seeing their future goals be achieved.</p>

      <p>Sustainability is a term that has been used frequently in past years. Malloy puts the term into a perspective that many can understand.</p>

      <p>“You still have to live, you still have to use what you have to do what you need to do, but doing so in a thoughtful way, so that you’re not necessarily taking away and causing further damage to the planet.”</p>

      <p>The University of Maryland embodies this new ideal of sustainability and students like Malloy are taking advantage of all the green efforts being made.</p>

      <p>Out of all the green programs being created she said that the Office of Sustainability is a great element to have on campus.</p>

      <p>“I think they do a really good job of trying to incorporate it into our everyday life.”</p>

      <p>Everyday incorporation is key to a sustainable life and the university makes it simple to take the first steps.</p>

      <p>The easiest step students can take is to utilize the color-coded trash cans. In every building across campus there are now three bins that are color-coded with what they represent. The compost bin is green, the recycle bin is blue, and the waste bin is black. The easily recognizable bins stand-out to students. Each bin even has pictures of what can go inside it so students are making the right decisions regarding the items they wish to throw away.</p>

      <p>Malloy understands though how simple measures can sometimes overwhelm and deter students.</p>

      <p>“I think people like students don’t necessarily take initiative by themselves sometimes. They just see the trash cans; they see the three different ones and go ahhhhh I don’t know and put it all in the trash.”</p>

      <p>She believes more could be done in terms of outreach.</p>

      <p>Beyond the efforts made with students though, the university is diligently working to be more sustainable.</p>

      <p>The core focus of their sustainability efforts have been on reaching carbon neutrality, or net zero carbon emissions, by 2050. Prioritizing this goal has positively impacted students.</p>

      <p>“I think definitely the carbon neutrality goal by 2050 is huge. That’s something that a lot of states are taking on, so I think it’s really important that we’re doing it as well,” Malloy said.</p>

      <p>One of the states that has tasked itself with reaching carbon neutrality is the state of Maryland.</p>

      <p>Large goals, like the carbon neutrality goal, get more attention, but many students do not realize how intertwined their campus life is with sustainability.</p>

      <p>Around 95% of freshman students live on-campus at the university meaning that they eat at the dining halls. Just by this action alone they are contributing to the campus’ sustainability effort because all leftover food in the dining halls is composted.</p>

      <p>The Office of Sustainability estimates that, “A total of 6.3 million pieces of waste has been eliminated through the use of reusable and washable products.”</p>

      <p>However, students who do not eat at the dinning halls on campus have to take it upon themselves to make sustainable decisions.</p>

      <p>Abbie Malloy suggests that students who live in apartments aim to use less or reuse.</p>

      <p>Even a small switch at the grocery store can make a difference.</p>

      <p>“If you have a glass jar like you get glass peanut butter instead of plastic,” Malloy said.</p>

      <p>It’s all about making conscious decisions wherever you go.</p>

      <p>“Trying to buy things in glass or paper instead of plastic is huge. Just because those things are easily recycled or like paper if it gets into the environment it will just break down, plastic won’t.”</p>

      <p>The University of Maryland has made it clear to the community that they want to be as sustainable as possible.</p>
